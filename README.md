# ChronoXchange

This is a high-performance cryptocurrency exchange matching engine built entirely in Go. It's designed with a microservices architecture to be scalable, concurrent, and maintainable.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is composed of four main microservices that communicate asynchronously via a Redis message broker.

* **API Server**: The main entry point for users. A REST API that handles user authentication, login, and order submission.
* **Matching Engine**: The core of the system. It hosts the orderbook, processes incoming orders, matches trades, and publishes results.
* **DB Processor**: A dedicated service that listens for trade and order data from the engine and persists it to the PostgreSQL database.
* **WebSocket Server**: Provides real-time updates (like new trades) to connected clients.

### Technology Stack

* **Language**: Go
* **Services**: PostgreSQL, Redis
* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
* **API Framework**: Gin
* **Database ORM**: GORM
* **Real-time Communication**: Gorilla WebSocket

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Go (1.21+)](https://go.dev/dl/) installed.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ChronoXchange.git](https://github.com/your-username/ChronoXchange.git)
    cd ChronoXchange
    ```

2.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your configuration.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="host=localhost user=your_user password=your_password dbname=exchange port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key"
    ```

3.  **Start backend services:**
    Run the PostgreSQL and Redis containers using Docker Compose.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Enable DB Extension (First Time Only):**
    Connect to the database and enable the UUID extension.
    ```bash
    docker exec -it exchange_postgres psql -U your_user -d exchange
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
    \q
    ```

5.  **Run the Go services:**
    Open four separate terminals in the project root and run each service.
    ```bash
    # Terminal 1
    go run ./cmd/api

    # Terminal 2
    go run ./cmd/engine

    # Terminal 3
    go run ./cmd/db-processor

    # Terminal 4
    go run ./cmd/ws
    ```
The system is now fully running.
